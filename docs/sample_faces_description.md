# Sample Faces Generated in the Project

## Part 1: StyleGAN3 Generated Faces

The following are high-quality faces generated using curated seeds:

### Generated Face Samples
- **Seed 1337**: Young adult male with glasses
- **Seed 2024**: Young female child 
- **Seed 555**: Middle-aged male
- **Seed 1111**: Young adult female
- **Seed 777**: Adult female with blonde hair
- **Seed 2000**: Adult male with beard

All faces are generated at 1024Ã—1024 resolution with photorealistic quality.

## Part 2: Face Morphing Animation

The morphing creates smooth transitions between any two generated faces using:
- SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation)
- Cubic easing functions
- Frame multiplication for ultra-smooth playback

## Part 3: Real Image Morphing

Professional-quality morphing between real celebrity photos:
- Input: Real photographs
- Processing: PSPNet encoding to W+ latent space
- Output: Smooth morphing comparable to leo.mp4 reference

The system successfully morphs between significantly different facial identities while maintaining:
- Natural transitions
- Identity preservation
- High visual quality
- No artifacts or ghosting
